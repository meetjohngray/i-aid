# Boilerplate: OpenAI React with Vite
This is a starter project that uses vite to transpile and bundle ES6 React code. It contains the code needed to start a project using OpenAI's chat completion api.

## Setup

### Installation
To use, consider these steps:

* Fork this repo
* Rename your repo according to the app you're building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm i
```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.

You will need to get an openai api key and store it in a `.env` file in the root of your project.
